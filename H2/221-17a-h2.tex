\begin{enumerate}
\item (15 points) Write a recursive function that counts the number of nodes
in a singly linked list. Write a recurrence relation that represents
your algorithm. Solve the relation and obtain the running time of
the algorithm in Big-O.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
  int nodeCounter(Node* n)
  {
    if(temp = = nullptr) { return 0; }

    return nodeCounter(n->next()) + 1;
  }
  \end{lstlisting}
  
  \item
  nodeCounter$(0) = 0$ \\
  nodeCounter$(n) =$ nodeCounter$(n-1) + 1$ \\

  \item
  Solving the relation: nodeCounter$(n) = 0$ \\
  The Big-$O: O(n)$
\end{enumerate}

\item (15 points) Write a recursive function that finds the maximum value
in an array of int values without using any loops. Write a recurrence
relation that represents your algorithm. Solve the relation and obtain
the running time of the algorithm in Big-O. \vfill{}
\item (10 points) What data structure is most suitable to determine if a
string s is a palindrome, that is, it is equal to its reverse. For
example, \textquotedblleft racecar\textquotedblright{} and \textquotedblleft gohan
gasalamiimalasagnahog\textquotedblright{} are palindromes. Justify
your answer. Use Big-O notation to represent the efficiency of your
algorithm. \vfill{}
\item (10 points) Describe how to implement the stack ADT using two queues.
What is the running time of the push and pop functions in this case?
\vfill{}
\item (10 points) What is the best, worst and average running time of quick
sort algorithm? Provide arrangement of the input and the selection
of the pivot point at every case. Provide a recursive relation and
solution for each case. \vfill{}
\item (10 points) What is the best, worst and average running time of merge
sort algorithm? Use two methods for solving a recurrence relation
for the average case to justify your answer. \vfill{}
\item (10 points) R-10.17 p. 493\\
For the following statements about red-black trees, provide a justification
for each true statement and a counterexample for each false one.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A subtree of a red-black tree is itself a red-black tree.\vspace{0.5in}
\item The sibling of an external node is either external or it is red.\vspace{0.5in}
\item There is a unique (2,4) tree associated with a given red-black tree.\vspace{0.5in}
\item There is a unique red-black tree associated with a given (2,4) tree.\vspace{0.5in}
\end{enumerate}
\item (10 points) R-10.19 p. 493\\
Consider a tree $T$ storing 100,000 entries. What is the worst-case
height of $T$ in the following cases?

\begin{enumerate}
\item $T$ is an AVL tree.\vspace{0.5in}
\item $T$ is a (2,4) tree.\vspace{0.5in}
\item $T$ is a red-black tree.\vspace{0.5in}
\item $T$ is a binary search tree.\vspace{0.5in}
\end{enumerate}
\item (10 points) R-9.16 p. 418

Draw an example skip list that results from performing the following
series of operations on the skip list shown in Figure 9.12: \texttt{erase(}38\texttt{),
insert(}48,x\texttt{), insert(}24,y\texttt{), erase(}55\texttt{)}.
Record your coin flips, as well.\vspace{0.5in}
\end{enumerate}
